Each Java project should follow a given coding style. I.e., all contributions to the source code should use the same 
formatting rules, design principles, code patterns, idioms, etc. This coding style provides the set of rules that I am using 
in my lectures about software development at Munich University of Applied Sciences.  

This project describes the coding style in detail (currently only in German) and serves as a template project. 
It provides all necessary resources for a Java project to enforce this coding style using the following 
static analysis tools via Maven (and partly in IntelliJ):
- [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org)
- [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/)
- [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io)
- [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info)
 
Moreover, it provides some sample classes that already use this style guide. This classes can be used as such but are not
required in this project. These classes also use some additional libraries that are included using the Maven
dependency mechanism. If the sample classes are deleted then the dependencies can be safely deleted, too.

This project and the associated static analysis tools are already running in continuous integration: an example 
CI pipeline is active for GitHub Actions. For [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) a complete CI pipeline has been 
configured that includes stages to compile, test, run static code analysis, run code coverage analysis, 
and run mutation coverage analysis, see section [Continuous Integration](doc/Continuous-Integration.md) for details. 
Additionally, some development tools are configured in this GitHub project, that evaluate the quality of pull requests, 
see section [integration of external tools](doc/Externe-Tool-Integration.md).

Content of the style guide (only in German):
- [Formatierung](doc/Formatierung.md)
- [Namensgebung](doc/Namensgebung.md)
- [Kommentare](doc/Kommentare.md)
- Testen
    - [Allgemeine Tipps zum Testen](doc/Testen.md)
    - [State Based vs. Interaction Based Testing](doc/State-Based-Vs-Interaction-Based.md)
    - [Testen von Schnittstellen und Basisklassen](doc/Abstract-Test-Pattern.md)
- [Fehlerbehandlung](doc/Fehlerbehandlung.md)
- [Best Practice](doc/Best-Practice.md)

A lot of ideas in this style are based on the following path-breaking books about software development: 

- [1] "The Elements of Java Style", Vermeulen, Ambler, Bumgardner, Metz, Misfeldt, Shur und Thompson, Cambridge University Press, 2000
- [2] "The Pragmatic Programmer. From Journeyman to Master", Andrew Hunt, David Thomas, Ward Cunningham, Addison Wesley, 1999
- [3] "Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction", Steve McConnell, Microsoft Press, 2004
- [4] "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship", Robert C. Martin, Prentice Hall, 2008
- [5] "Effective Java", Third Edition, Joshua Bloch, Addison Wesley, 2017
- [6] "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code", Martin Fowler, Addison Wesley, 1999 
- [7] "Java by Comparison", Simon Harrer, JÃ¶rg Lenhard, Linus Dietz, Pragmatic Programmers, 2018
